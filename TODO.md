## WHAT'S NEXT üöÄ
### PHASE 6: Critical UI Improvements üéØ HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] **SCALING ISSUE**: UI too small on large screens (1080p/1440p) - Need larger elements
  - [ ] Scale up card images (currently 60x80, 80x110)
  - [ ] Increase font sizes for labels and text
  - [ ] Expand window size and element spacing
  - [ ] Test on different screen resolutions
  - [ ] Make UI responsive to screen size

- [ ] **CARD BACK COLOR**: Player cards showing red backs instead of blue
  - [ ] Currently using `card_back_suits.png` (red) for player
  - [ ] Need to either:
    - [ ] Find/create blue card back image, OR
    - [ ] Programmatically tint the existing card back blue, OR
    - [ ] Use different card back asset for player vs CPU
  - [ ] Ensure visual distinction: Player = Blue, CPU = Red/Dark

### PHASE 7: Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Add win/lose animations
- [ ] Add card dealing animations
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Add game statistics tracking
- [ ] Add different card back themes

## CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX üîß
1. **UI Scaling Problem**: Everything appears tiny on high-resolution screens
2. **Card Back Mismatch**: Player should have blue backs, not red


## TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS üìù
- ‚úÖ Card-to-filename mapping system working perfectly
- ‚úÖ Responsive image sizing without magic numbers
- ‚úÖ Hidden placeholders with show/hide system
- ‚úÖ Stable layout that doesn't shift with text changes
- ‚úÖ All 55 cards displaying correctly including special jokers
- ‚úÖ **Custom Fyne widgets with hover and click detection** ‚≠ê NEW!
