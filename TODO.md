## WHAT'S NEXT 🚀
### PHASE 6: Critical UI Improvements 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY
- [x] **SCALING ISSUE**: UI too small on large screens (1080p/1440p) - Need larger elements
  - [x] Scale up card images (currently 60x80, 80x110)
  - [x] Increase font sizes for labels and text
  - [x] Expand window size and element spacing
  - [x] Test on different screen resolutions

### PHASE 7: UI Polish & User Experience ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **NOTIFICATION SYSTEM REMOVAL**: Removed entire notification overlay system
  - [x] Eliminated awkward overlay that appeared behind cards
  - [x] Removed technical setup messages ("Deck created", "Deck shuffled", etc.)

  - [x] Enhanced "How to Play" dialog with complete card hierarchy
  - [x] More professional, modern game feel

## 🎯 WEEK 2 GOALS - SHIP IT!
**Theme: Polish, Fix Bugs, and Add Fun Features**
*Remember: Done is better than perfect for your first project!*

## 🔥 QUICK WINS (Day 1-2) - Start Here!

### 1. Fix Blue Card Back Bug ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Blue card back filename has a space!
  - Current: `"Cards/card_back_ suits_blue.png"` (space after underscore)
  - Fix in `main.go` line 65: Change to `"Cards/card_back_suits_blue.png"` (no space)
- [x] Test that player cards now show blue backs

### 2. Add Game Statistics ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] The stats work, but I had to limit the text length for it. Need to investigate I consider this good enough.

### 3. Add Simple Menu System (3-4 hours) 🎮 ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create main menu with:
  - Start New Game button
  - How to Play button (shows rules)
  - Quit button
- [x] Add "New Game" button after game ends
- [x] Enhanced How to Play with complete card hierarchy and game info
### 4. Add Speed Mode (4-5 hours) ⚡
- [x] **DECIDED NOT TO IMPLEMENT** - Players want to play games, not watch them play themselves!

### 5. Improve War Display (3-4 hours) 🎴 ✅ COMPLETE!
- [x] **DRAMATIC 3-PHASE WAR SEQUENCE**: 
  - Phase 1 (5s): Show tied cards that caused the war

## 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIXES ✅ COMPLETE!

### Main Menu & Game Reset Issues (MUST FIX)
- [x] **Fixed "Start New Game" not resetting properly**
  - Problem: Clicking main menu → start new game showed old game state
  - Solution: Proper container cleanup and fresh game creation
  - Method: `gameContainer.Objects = []fyne.CanvasObject{}` + rebuild
  
- [x] **Fixed card click disable during wars**
  - Problem: Players could spam-click during 8-second war sequence

- [x] **Comprehensive testing**: Tests for reset functionality and click states

### 6. Add Simple Animations (4-5 hours) 🎨 ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

  - Realistic shake using dual sine waves (fast + slow oscillation)
  - Natural decay effect that fades out over 1.5 seconds
  - Perfectly targets just the card battle zone (not whole screen)
  - Uses `fyne.NewAnimation()` with `AnimationEaseOut` curve
  - Enhanced war experience with focused visual impact
